# sickocode
Just as Andre "Dr. Dre" Young mentored a young Marshall "Eminem" Mathers, 
we, Quinn, Josh, Tim, and Andrew, have trained and tested "sickocode" to be
one of the best rappers of the 21st century. 
Oh yeah, it's a computer. A computer whose fire bars might just catch your 
house on fire, steal your girl, and have your parents asking you to turn 
down the volume.
